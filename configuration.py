# For example, "variable 1,variable 2" identifies the two variables returned by the extractor.
# If only one name is specified, no comma's are used.
# Note that variable names cannot have comma's in them: use a different separator instead. Also,
# all white space is kept intact; don't add any extra whitespace since it may cause name comparisons
# to fail
